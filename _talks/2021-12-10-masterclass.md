On November 7th and December 10th I gave a two part workshop to professional data scientists working at the University Medical Centre, Utrecht. The aim of the workshop was to introduce
researchers to modern methods for causal modeling. 

Part 1 of the workshop covered Causal Inference, that is, the specification of causal models and estimation of causal effects from data. This included an intro to both the potential outcomes framework of Rubin and others and the Structural Causal Modeling framework of Pearl and others.

Part 2 of the workshop covered Causal Discovery, that is, tools to learn causal structure from data.
