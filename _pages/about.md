I work as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Methodology and Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/methodology-and-statistics) at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. I develop methodological and statistical approaches to help social and behavioural scientists take full advantage of various data types to study complex phenomena, such as the causal systems underlying mental disorder, and the dynamics of cognitive, behavioural and emotional processes in daily life.  

My research touches on time series analysis and dynamical systems, causal modeling, graphical models, Bayesian statistics and computational modeling. The tools I develop are broadly applicable across different areas of (behavioural) science and I collaborate with researchers from diverse backgrounds, such as clinical psychology and psychiaty, biomedical research, linguisitics and public policy. All of the code I develop is made accessible either through reproducibility archives or R packages. See my page on [software and code](https://oisinryan.org/code) for details.

As part of my teaching work I have helped develop a number of new courses and workshops. These include a summer school on [time series analysis of intensive longitudinal data](https://utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/social-sciences/modeling-the-dynamics-of-intensive-longitudinal-data), courses on causal modeling for data science researchers, and workshops on theory formalisation and computational modeling in psychological research.

I am a strong believer in open science practices, so I strive to make all my [papers and pre-prints](https://oisinryan.org/pulications), [presentations](https://oisinryan.org/talks), [workshop and teaching materials](https://oisinryan.org/workshops), [and code](https://oisinryan.org/code) open and easily accessible.
