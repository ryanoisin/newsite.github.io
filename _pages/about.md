I work as an assistant professor at the [Department of Data Science and Biostatistics](https://juliuscentrum.umcutrecht.nl/en/data-science-and-biostatistics) at the University Medical Centre Utrecht in the Netherlands. I develop tools and approaches which help scientists across the biomedical, social and behavioural sciences study causal relations with non-experimental data. 

My research focuses on causal inference and causal discovery, as well as time-series analysis, graphical models, Bayesian statistics and computational modeling. I collaborate with researchers from diverse backgrounds, such as epidemiology, clinical psychology and psychiaty, linguisitics and public policy. All of the code I develop is made accessible either through reproducibility archives or R packages. See my page on [software and code](https://oisinryan.org/code) for details.

As part of my teaching work I have helped develop a number of new courses and workshops. These include a masters course and two-day workshop on causal modeling [causal modeling for data scientists](https://github.com/ryanoisin/IntroCausalModeling2021), a summer school on [time series analysis of intensive longitudinal data](https://utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/social-sciences/modeling-the-dynamics-of-intensive-longitudinal-data), and invited workshops on topics such as [causal policy evaluation using register data](https://causalpolicy.nl) and [theory formalisation and computational modeling in psychological research](https://github.com/ryanoisin/FormalTheoryWorkshop).

I am a strong believer in open science practices, so I strive to make all my [papers and pre-prints](https://oisinryan.org/pulications), [presentations](https://oisinryan.org/talks), [workshop and teaching materials](https://oisinryan.org/workshops), and [code](https://oisinryan.org/code) open and easily accessible.
