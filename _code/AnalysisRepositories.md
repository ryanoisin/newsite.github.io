I strive to make the code I use for analyses in all of my papers open and available through reproducibility archives. 

Typically you can access these by clicking on the paper of interest on my publications page.

The archives themselves are a mix of [github](https://github.com/ryanoisin) and [OSF](https://osf.io/x2vgu) repositories.
